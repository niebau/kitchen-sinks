# WTF? 

A collection of Kitchen Sinks to test framework components within webpages. Initialy started to test some Bootstrap 3.x templates.

## Folders 

In `/integrations`, you will find kitchen sinks without `<html>` and `<body>` tags. 
For bootstrap, the code should be integrated within a `<div class="container"></div>` in the webpage yout want to test. 

In `/original`, yout will find the base sinks html that are used to compile the other HTMLs.
